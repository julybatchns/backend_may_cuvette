// ! A REST API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate with each other over HTTP. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

// ? REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP.

// ? Resources: Entities that the API is designed to manage (e.g., users, products).
// \* Endpoints: URLs that represent resources or collections of resources.
// ! Statelessness: Each request from a client contains all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. No session state is stored on the server.
// ? JSON: The most common format for data exchange in REST APIs.
